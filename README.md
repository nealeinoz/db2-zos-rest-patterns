Db2 z/OS REST Service Manager Patterns

This repository contains source examples for creating and using Db2 z/OS REST APIs.
Db2 z/OS contains a REST Service Manager as part of the DDF Address Space.

Db2 REST Services can be created in multiple ways, including
- Db2 BIND SERVICE command, that can be submitted via JCL
- Curl commands, that can be submitted from any client with TCPIP connection to DDF
- IDEs ( such as Postman )

The examples in this repository go from simple to advanced.
- Simple Query with Input Parameters
- Simple Write with Input Parameters
- Stored Procedure with Input Parameters and Output Results Sets
- Temporal History APIs
- Curated Data APIs
- Heterogeneous Data Aps ( with IDF )
- Multi-Speed Classes of Service

Hopefully they will be helpful examples as an introduction to DB2 REST Service Manager Usage
